Adds tinyMCE, HTML, and shortcode support to Thesis Category intros.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the visual editor to your category introductions. It also enables shortcodes in these areas and should function just fine with most tinyMCE plugins. This allows you to have more than just plaintext intros. Please note that this plugin is for Thesis only, although could probably be adjusted for other themes with similar functionality.

== Installation ==

1. Upload file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
Alternatively:
1. Search for "Thesis Archive Intro" in the Plugins->Add New dashboard

== Screenshots ==

1. Visual editor in your category intro. Yay!
